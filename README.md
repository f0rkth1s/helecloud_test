# helecloud_test  

Time sheet:  
Date		-	T	-	RT	-	Description of progress  
8/6/22	-	1h	-	1h	-	Setup local environment with tfenv/tf/awscli - Base setup for creation of EC2 in my default VPC & subnet, with remote state storage in S3
9/6/22	-	2h	-	3h	-	keys/vpc/subnet/sg/igw/routing/instances with count/basic efs - all working apart from provisioner which works for only the first instance and fails with i/o timeout on subsequent
10/6/22	-	2h	-	5h	-	Fixed provisioner by replacing with a user_data to run the shell script - Working now, pain.
11/6/22	-	3h	-	8h	-	Got ELB working - moved from aws_instance to launch_config/aws_autoscaling_group - made more work for myself because I had created a new vpc and subnet
12/6/22	-	2h30m	-	10h	-	Resetup laptop for work as Wife was on PC - provisioned efs, thought efs was mounting but it isn't likely to do with TF variables not passing through, tidied up file structure. Ran out of time at 5pm deadline

To complete
efs - working mount
rds - provision and mount
cloudwatch alarm - enable

Future ideas:
Iterating count for fe_servers names when generated by aws_autoscaling_group
separate efs subnet
Create more vars to allow for re-use for creating multple environments within accounts
Expand further using terragrunt and variablise all specific counts for dry base
